## Installing SPM

Before you run an installer JAR file, you must have your SPM `license` folder in the location where you run the installer command.

Run each of the installers (full or delta) using the following steps:

* Substitute `<installername.jar>` with your actual installer file name to run this command:

    ```shell
    java -jar <installername.jar>
    ```

This command starts the SPM (izPack) installer.

* Go through the installation dialogs as follows:

* Click _Next_ on the Welcome screen.
  * The value for _Select the installation path:_ defaults to: `./IBM/Curam/Development`
    Change this value as needed, be aware that the default value appends to the working directory from where you ran the Java command.
    * Click _Next_.
    * Respond to the dialog to create or reuse the installation folder.
  * For _Select the language of the application_, select a language. Note: If left blank _English - United States_ is the default.
