title: Preparing Helm charts
description: Preparing Helm charts
---

The [spm-kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/spm-kubernetes) repository provides nine Helm charts:

* *apps:* defines how to deploy the IBM® WebSphere® Liberty images with the SPM application.
* *batch:* defines the batch image configuration.
* *ce-app:* defines how to deploy the Universal Access (React) application.
* *configmaps:* contains a group of common configurations across multiple images.
* *ihs:* defines how to deploy the static content image for SPM (`Curam` image only).
* *mqserver:* defines the IBM WebSphere MQ image configuration.
* *openldap:* defines the OpenLDAP image configuration (used for session failover).
* *xmlserver:* defines the xmlserver container configuration.
* *spm:* an umbrella chart to contain all the other charts.

The charts use a templating mechanism to create the YAML file that is used by Kubernetes.
For this reason, the main configuration values are stored for each chart in a `values.yaml` file in the main folder of the charts.
The values can also be overwritten by the `spm:*` umbrella chart or by a provided override file during deployment as described in [Deploying Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment).

YAML is a human-readable structured data format. It provides powerful configuration settings, without having to learn a more complex code type like CSS, JavaScript, or PHP.

## Preparing to run the Helm charts

Before you run the charts, you must configure the database, configure IBM MQ, and test the charts.

### Configuring the database

Update the Helm charts to point to the database that you installed in
[Install Prerequisite Software](/01-prereq/prereq).
The following values are provided in the  `values.yaml` files and must be modified before deployment to reflect your local environment:

```
global:
  database:
    type: "DB2"
    hostname: "dbhostname"
    dbName: "dbName"
    serviceName: ""
    username: "dbuser"
    spm_psw: "spmEncryptedDBPassword"
    wlp_psw: "xorEncodedDBPassword"
    port: 50000
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** To use an Oracle database, two changes are required:

* Change the `global.database.type` property value to `ORA`
* Set the `serviceName` property (corresponds to the `curam.db.oracle.servicename` property in Bootstrap.properties)

</InlineNotification>

All of the above values are required for a successful deployment.

`global.database.spm_psw` is equavalent to the `curam.db.password` property in `Bootstrap.properties`.
The value can be obtained by running `./build.sh encrypt -Dpassword=<password>` from any SPM installation.

`global.database.wlp_psw` is the WebSphere Liberty WebSphere `{xor}` encoding of the database password. The value can be obtained by using `$WLP_HOME/bin/securityUtility encode <password>`.

While it is possible to update the values directly in the `spm` chart, it is advisable to maintain a separate YAML file with values specific to your environment.
The YAML file will be used by the `helm install` command that is described in [Deploying Helm charts](/04-deployment/hc_deployment).

<InlineNotification>

SPM's Helm charts follow the parent chart/subcharts model, and therefore the values must be within the `global:` mapping to be applied globally.

You can find the full list of values available to override in `$SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm/values.yaml`

### Configuring IBM MQ

IBM MQ is already configured to work out of the box with a secure connection with IBM WebSphere Liberty.
The commands that create all the objects that are needed on the queue manager are defined in a config map, in the `configmap-mqsc.yaml` file.
However, there is a default password that you must change, as in the case of the database.
The password is in the `$SPM_HOME/helm-charts/mqserver/values.yaml` file under the name `adminPasswordKey`. The password allows access to the IBM MQ web console.

Passwords can also be stored in secrets, as for the certificates. However, for the scope of this runbook, passwords can be configured in values files or, preferably, overwritten at runtime.

### Linting the Helm charts

Use the following command during development to verify the syntax and correctness of the generated YAML files. Run the command inside a Chart folder:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts/spm
helm lint .
```

### Configuring Batch heap size

The heap size of the batch processing can be adjusted by specifying the `heapSize` property within the values override file. The defaults are currently:

```
batch:
 javaMetrics:
     heapSize: "-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
```

## Packaging the Helm charts

To use the Helm Charts to install SPM, package the charts and load them into a repository. For more information, see [ChartMuseum](/01-prereq/chartmuseum).

To publish the individual charts to the Chart museum repository, run the following commands from the helm-charts folder. The commands also use the `$SPM_HOME` value that is defined in [Install prerequisite software](/01-prereq/git):

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts
helm push apps local-development
helm push mqserver local-development
helm push configmaps local-development
helm push xmlserver local-development
helm push batch local-development
helm push ihs local-development
helm push ce-app local-development
helm push openldap local-development
helm repo update
```

**Note:** Kubernetes by default has limits set on resources such as memory and CPU usage. SPM containers require more resources than the default values that we have set.
We have set the default resource values to the limits that we have found to work best during development.

_The resource values are subject to change during further iterations._

The resource values can be changed. However, for troubleshooting, we will request that our default values are used at a minimum.

To generate the umbrella chart that is used for the deployment, run the following commands:

```shell
cd $SPM_HOME/helm-charts
helm dep up spm/
helm push spm local-development
helm repo update
```
