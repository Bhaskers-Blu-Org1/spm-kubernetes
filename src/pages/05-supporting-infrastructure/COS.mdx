### What is IBM Cloud Object Storage?

IBM® Cloud&trade; Object Storage (COS) makes it possible to store practically limitless amounts of data, simply and cost effectively.
It is commonly used for data archiving and backup; for web and mobile applications; and as scalable, persistent storage for analytics.
Flexible storage class tiers with a policy-based archive let you effectively manage costs while meeting data access needs.
The integrated IBM Aspera® high-speed data transfer option makes it easy to transfer data to and from IBM Cloud Object Storage, and query-in-place functionality allows you to run analytics directly on your data.

### Usage

In order to archive data persistently through COS, the following prerequisites need to be prepared in the Kubernetes cluster:

* Create a bucket in the COS service by following the [Getting Started guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)
* Take note of the `bucket-name`, `access-key`, `secret-key` and `service-private-endpoint` for the bucket
* Install the COS Plugin into your cluster by following the [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-object_storage)
* Enable persistence by toggling the following properties in the override values file injected through Helm during deployment:
